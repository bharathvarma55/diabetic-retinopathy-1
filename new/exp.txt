'haar' - Haar wavelet compression is an efficient way to perform both lossless and lossy image compression. It relies
on averaging and differencing values in an image matrix to produce a matrix which is sparse or nearly sparse.
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which a large portion of its entries are 0. A sparse matrix can be stored in an
efficient manner, leading to smaller file sizes.

kmeans
kmeans(data, K, bestLabels, criteria, attempts, flags)
@param K Number of clusters to split the set by
@param bestLabels Input/output integer array that stores the cluster indices for every sample.
@param criteria The algorithm termination criteria, that is, the maximum number of iterations and/or
       the desired accuracy. The accuracy is specified as criteria.epsilon. As soon as each of the cluster
       centers moves by less than criteria.epsilon on some iteration, the algorithm stops.
@param attempts Flag to specify the number of times the algorithm is executed using different
       initial labellings. The algorithm returns the labels that yield the best compactness (see the last
       function parameter).
@param flags Flag that can take values of cv::KmeansFlags
