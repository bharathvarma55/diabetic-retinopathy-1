IMPLEMENTATION 

we take the images from the dataset and scale down the images as they are of high megapixeled and of large sized we scale them down to process and 
train the model faster

then using cvtcolor from cv2 we convert the image into black and white
then we use equilizehhist method from cv2 to normalize the shadows and hightlights of the image

the first method we use is py wavelet to scale down the images and remove distortions from image

then we apply the guassin filter to convert the image into black and white 
this filter not only converts the image into b&w but also retains the details of the image compared to other filters
which converts the image into a gradient image 
the reason we are doing this is because we need the contrast difference between shadows and highlights to differentiate between the featuers

then using svm we train the model which extracts the features form the model and plots them on 3d hyperplane as there are more than 2 features

then we take input from the user and do the whole process on the input image but on a small scale then pass those image into trained model
which extracts the featues from these images then tries to match features with the features extracted from the training data 
if any features match then the model will classify the image as positive which means the person is having diabetic retinopathy
